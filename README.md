## Introduction
This repository contains materials for an Oxford Intelligent Earth CDT workshop on Gaussian Processes (GPs) for probabilistic earthquake ground motion prediction. The workshop aims to provide participants with hands-on experience in using GPs for as part of a workflow for predicting earthquake ground motions, in a proof-of-concept example.

## Installation
You can use Binder to run the notebook online without any installation. Click the Binder badge at the top of this README to launch the notebooks in your browser. It is recommended **not** to run model training on Binder, as it may take much longer than on your computer; choose from the pre-trained models instead.

Alternatively, you can install the required dependencies to run the notebook `workbook.ipynb` using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
It is recommended to install the dependencies in a virtual environment.

## Usage
Click the Binder badge at the top of this README to launch the notebook in your browser, and follow the instructions in the notebook.

If you would like to run this notebook on your computer, first clone the repository and install the required dependencies (see above). You can then launch the Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Then, open the notebook file to start the workshop exercises.
